Maple - Synced Multiplayer Gaming with Node and Websockets
==========================================================

Maple is a straightforward implementation of a basic, tick synced multiplayer 
architecture, that's lightweight and easy to extend.

## Demo

1. Run `node demo/server.js`
2. Open `demo/index.html` in a Browser with WebSocket support
3. Check your Browser Console and watch the magic happen!

## Features

- Synced tick count, gametime, pseudo RNG and message queue
- Ships with `Twist` - a awesome JS game loop
- WebSocket support for all existing Drafts
- Works with Node.js `v0.4` and later
- Uses [BiSON](https://github.com/BonsaiDen/BiSON.js) for lowest possible bandwidth
- Comes with a simple Class abstraction


## TODO

- Finish documentation
- Unit tests
- More inline comments around the actual magic
- Add some kittens!
