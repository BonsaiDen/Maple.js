Maple - Synced Multiplayer Gaming with Node and Websockets
==========================================================

Maple is a straightforward implementation of a basic, tick synced multiplayer 
architecture, that's lightweight and easy to extend.

## Demo

1. Run `node run.js`
2. Open `index.html` in a Browser with WebSocket support
3. Check your Browser Console and see the magic happen.

## Features

- Synced tick count, gametime, pseudo rng and message queue
- Ships with `Twist` - a awesome JS GameLoop
- WebSocket support for all existing Drafts
- Works with Node.js `v0.4` and later
- Uses [BiSON](https://github.com/BonsaiDen/BiSON.js) for lowest possible bandwidth
- Comes with [Neko.js](https://github.com/BonsaiDen/neko.js) for simple `Class` abstraction


## TODO

- Finish documentation
- Unit tests
- More inline comments around the actual magic
- Add some kittens!
